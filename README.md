Take a look of my last projects:

1. **[ALMA_chatbot](https://github.com/Lacave91/ALMA_chatbot):** *Your multilingual therapist, but make it AI.*

Say hello to ALMA — your emotionally intelligent, video-savvy health assistant. It speaks both English and Spanish, understands your wellness questions, and replies with precision (and compassion). Powered by embeddings and YouTube transcript analysis, ALMA not only talks back — it points you to exactly where in a video the answer lives.


2. **[Robo-project](https://github.com/Lacave91/Robo-project):** *Amazon reviews got you like 😩? Let the robot read for you.*
   
This isn’t just another NLP dashboard. Robo digs through thousands of product reviews, clusters them into themes, and uses LLMs to give you the TL;DR on what really matters. Want to know if that air fryer is worth it? Robo's got the receipts.


3. **[NLP-Project](https://github.com/Lacave91/NPL-project):** *Is it real? Is it fake? Let the model investigate.*
   
We built a no-nonsense, high-accuracy classifier to separate facts from fiction. Armed with the latest NLP techniques, our model dissects news articles and tells you whether it’s worthy of belief — or belongs in the bin.

4. **[DeepLearning-project-CNN](https://github.com/Lacave91/DeepLearning-project-CNN):** *Does this image look like a cat, dog, or elephant? The model knows.*
   
A computer vision project where we went full neural net on the Animals10 dataset. Started with a basic CNN, leveled up with batch norm + dropout, and finished with a fine-tuned VGG16 model — now deployed and ready to tell you exactly what’s in that cute animal pic.
